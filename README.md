The file ps05.txt contains the names (name) and the email addresses (email) of 24 students enrolled in SOMECLASS, as well as the groups they were assigned to for the first two problem sets (ps1 and ps2, respectively). Import the data then Re-assign the groups set such that no student is assigned to the same group with a student whom he or she has previously worked with.
